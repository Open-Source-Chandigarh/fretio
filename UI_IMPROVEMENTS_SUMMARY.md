## üîÑ Iterative Approach

Rather than a big-bang release, consider:

### **Option A: Feature Flags**
- Deploy features behind flags
- Enable for % of users
- Gather feedback
- Iterate

### **Option B: Phased Rollout**
- Release Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Gather feedback
- Release Phase 2 (Components)
- Continue iterating

### **Option C: A/B Testing**
- Test new vs old design
- Measure engagement metrics
- Choose winner
- Roll out fully

**Recommended:** Combination of A & B
